# electronJS-first

First test building something with ElectronJS. Unfortunately it can't be hosted anywhere so the only way to view it is to clone and run the app on your local computer

It's a basic app that shows you current computer stats such as how much memory you are using, how much is free, and the total memory allotted to your PC. 

If I had to rebuild it today I would use Tauri instead (and actually add more features lol). But Tauri wasn't that big yet when I decided to mess with building a Desktop App, this was a little personal project to play around with so it probably won't see a resurgence anytime soon lol

You can run locally using the normal commands

<code>npm install</code>

<code>npm run start</code>

NOTE: it won't work if you're using WSL. The linux environment doesn't play nice with Electron. You can use normal Powershell or Git Bash or whatever else you choose.
