# electronJS-first

First test building something with ElectronJS. Unfortunately it can't be hosted anywhere so the only way to view it is to clone and run the app on your local computer

I'ts a basic app that shows you current computer stats such as how much memory you are using, the temp levels, etc. 

If I had to rebuild it today I would use Tauri instead. It wasn't that big when I decided to mess with building a Desktop App, but this was a little personal project to play around with so it probably won't see a resurgence anytime soon lol
